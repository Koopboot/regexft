# regexft
 Regex Filter Text: This PowerShell GUI (WinForms) allows users to perform multiple regex searches on text data. The regex results are then used to populate a template, generating the desired text output. Users can save presets for future use.

Configs are saved in %appdata%\regexft

Known Problems:
- The GUI seems to be really broken with high dpi monitor settings (Useable but not nice designed)
